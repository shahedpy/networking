Overview

Routing protocols are used by routers to exchange reachability information and build forwarding and route tables. They fall into multiple families (distance-vector, link-state, path-vector, and hybrids). The pages in this folder provide short explanations, operational notes, common pitfalls, and recommended commands.

See also the course syllabus and course PDFs under `docs/pdfs/` for deeper reading and original slides.
