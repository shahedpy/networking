## Overview

IP addressing is fundamental to network communication. This section covers:

1. **Classless addressing (CIDR)** — flexible addressing without class boundaries
2. **NAT** — address translation for private-to-public IP mapping
3. **IANA & RIRs** — global IP address allocation and governance
4. **ISP roles** — how ISPs obtain and distribute address blocks
5. **IPv4 anatomy** — structure of 32-bit addresses, network/host portions
6. **Subnet masks** — identifying network and host portions
7. **Subnetting** — dividing networks into smaller subnets
8. **VLSM** — variable-length subnets for efficient address usage
