## Internet Protocol (IP)
- The Internet Protocol is the corner-stone of the TCP/lP architecture. All computers in the Internet understand IP.
- The main tasks of IP are:
 - The **addressing** of the computers, and the **fragmentation** of packets.
- There are two types of Internet Protocol:
 - **Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4):** currently used version of Internet Protocol.
 - **Internet Protocol version 6 (fPv6):** the upcoming replacement for IPv4. It contains some major improvements and new features.
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address that uniquely and universally defines the connection of a device (for example, a computer or a router) to the Internet.
 - Connectionless protocol
 - Fragments (divides) packets where necessary
 - Addressing via 32 bit Internet addresses
- However, it contains no functions for end-to-end message reliability or flow control. IP makes the 'best effort' to forward packets to the next destination, but does not guarantee delivery because it is connectionless.
- The IP address can be classify into two classes:
 - **Public address:** This address considered as any valid address assigned to any user, and the organization who is responsible for registering IP ranges called Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and this address will be unique.
 - **Private Address:** Any number or address assigned to a device on a private TCP/IP Local Area Network that is accessible only within the Local Area Network.
