# Network Security

This folder covers network security topics from the syllabus, focusing on cryptography and security protocols.

- [Public Key Cryptography (RSA)](rsa.md)
- [RSA Practice Problems](rsa-problems.md)

## Overview

Network security is essential for protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. This section covers:

1. **Asymmetric key cryptography** — public/private key pairs for secure communication
2. **RSA algorithm** — widely-used public key cryptosystem
3. **RSA practice problems** — hands-on calculation and application

## Key Concepts

- **Confidentiality** — only authorized parties can read data
- **Integrity** — data hasn't been tampered with
- **Authentication** — verify identity of communicating parties
- **Non-repudiation** — sender cannot deny sending a message

## Cryptography Types

### Symmetric Cryptography
- Same key for encryption and decryption
- Fast, efficient
- Key distribution challenge
- Examples: AES, DES, 3DES

### Asymmetric Cryptography
- Public key for encryption, private key for decryption (or vice versa)
- Solves key distribution problem
- Slower than symmetric
- Examples: RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman
